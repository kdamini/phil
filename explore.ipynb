       "'SCENE: The House of Agathon.Concerning the things about which you ask to be informed I believe thatI am not ill-prepared with an answer. For the day before yesterday Iwas coming from my own home at Phalerum to the city, and one of myacquaintance, who had caught a sight of me from behind, calling outplayfully in the distance, said: Apollodorus, O thou Phalerian (Probablya play of words on (Greek), \\'bald-headed.\\') man, halt! So I did as Iwas bid; and then he said, I was looking for you, Apollodorus, only justnow, that I might ask you about the speeches in praise of love, whichwere delivered by Socrates, Alcibiades, and others, at Agathon\\'s supper.Phoenix, the son of Philip, told another person who told me of them;his narrative was very indistinct, but he said that you knew, and I wishthat you would give me an account of them. Who, if not you, should bethe reporter of the words of your friend? And first tell me, he said,were you present at this meeting?Your informant, Glaucon, I said, must have been very indistinct indeed,if you imagine that the occasion was recent; or that I could have beenof the party.Why, yes, he replied, I thought so.Impossible: I said. Are you ignorant that for many years Agathon has notresided at Athens; and not three have elapsed since I became acquaintedwith Socrates, and have made it my daily business to know all that hesays and does. There was a time when I was running about the world,fancying myself to be well employed, but I was really a most wretchedbeing, no better than you are now. I thought that I ought to do anythingrather than be a philosopher.Well, he said, jesting apart, tell me when the meeting occurred.In our boyhood, I replied, when Agathon won the prize with his firsttragedy, on the day after that on which he and his chorus offered thesacrifice of victory.Then it must have been a long while ago, he said; and who told you--didSocrates?No indeed, I replied, but the same person who told Phoenix;--he was alittle fellow, who never wore any shoes, Aristodemus, of the deme ofCydathenaeum. He had been at Agathon\\'s feast; and I think that inthose days there was no one who was a more devoted admirer of Socrates.Moreover, I have asked Socrates about the truth of some parts of hisnarrative, and he confirmed them. Then, said Glaucon, let us have thetale over again; is not the road to Athens just made for conversation?And so we walked, and talked of the discourses on love; and therefore,as I said at first, I am not ill-prepared to comply with your request,and will have another rehearsal of them if you like. For to speak or tohear others speak of philosophy always gives me the greatest pleasure,to say nothing of the profit. But when I hear another strain, especiallythat of you rich men and traders, such conversation displeases me; andI pity you who are my companions, because you think that you are doingsomething when in reality you are doing nothing. And I dare say thatyou pity me in return, whom you regard as an unhappy creature, and veryprobably you are right. But I certainly know of you what you only thinkof me--there is the difference.COMPANION: I see, Apollodorus, that you are just the same--alwaysspeaking evil of yourself, and of others; and I do believe that you pityall mankind, with the exception of Socrates, yourself first of all, truein this to your old name, which, however deserved, I know not how youacquired, of Apollodorus the madman; for you are always raging againstyourself and everybody but Socrates.APOLLODORUS: Yes, friend, and the reason why I am said to be mad, andout of my wits, is just because I have these notions of myself and you;no other evidence is required.COMPANION: No more of that, Apollodorus; but let me renew my requestthat you would repeat the conversation.APOLLODORUS: Well, the tale of love was on this wise:--But perhaps I hadbetter begin at the beginning, and endeavour to give you the exact wordsof Aristodemus:He said that he met Socrates fresh from the bath and sandalled; and asthe sight of the sandals was unusual, he asked him whither he was goingthat he had been converted into such a beau:--To a banquet at Agathon\\'s, he replied, whose invitation to his sacrificeof victory I refused yesterday, fearing a crowd, but promising that Iwould come to-day instead; and so I have put on my finery, because he issuch a fine man. What say you to going with me unasked?I will do as you bid me, I replied.Follow then, he said, and let us demolish the proverb:--\\'To the feasts of inferior men the good unbidden go;\\'instead of which our proverb will run:--\\'To the feasts of the good the good unbidden go;\\'and this alteration may be supported by the authority of Homer himself,who not only demolishes but literally outrages the proverb. For, afterpicturing Agamemnon as the most valiant of men, he makes Menelaus, whois but a fainthearted warrior, come unbidden (Iliad) to the banquet ofAgamemnon, who is feasting and offering sacrifices, not the better tothe worse, but the worse to the better.I rather fear, Socrates, said Aristodemus, lest this may still be mycase; and that, like Menelaus in Homer, I shall be the inferior person,who\\'To the feasts of the wise unbidden goes.\\'But I shall say that I was bidden of you, and then you will have to makean excuse.\\'Two going together,\\'he replied, in Homeric fashion, one or other of them may invent anexcuse by the way (Iliad).This was the style of their conversation as they went along. Socratesdropped behind in a fit of abstraction, and desired Aristodemus, who waswaiting, to go on before him. When he reached the house of Agathonhe found the doors wide open, and a comical thing happened. A servantcoming out met him, and led him at once into the banqueting-hall inwhich the guests were reclining, for the banquet was about to begin.Welcome, Aristodemus, said Agathon, as soon as he appeared--you are justin time to sup with us; if you come on any other matter put it off, andmake one of us, as I was looking for you yesterday and meant to haveasked you, if I could have found you. But what have you done withSocrates?I turned round, but Socrates was nowhere to be seen; and I had toexplain that he had been with me a moment before, and that I came by hisinvitation to the supper.You were quite right in coming, said Agathon; but where is he himself?He was behind me just now, as I entered, he said, and I cannot thinkwhat has become of him.Go and look for him, boy, said Agathon, and bring him in; and do you,Aristodemus, meanwhile take the place by Eryximachus.The servant then assisted him to wash, and he lay down, and presentlyanother servant came in and reported that our friend Socrates hadretired into the portico of the neighbouring house. \\'There he is fixed,\\'said he, \\'and when I call to him he will not stir.\\'How strange, said Agathon; then you must call him again, and keepcalling him.Let him alone, said my informant; he has a way of stopping anywhere andlosing himself without any reason. I believe that he will soon appear;do not therefore disturb him.Well, if you think so, I will leave him, said Agathon. And then, turningto the servants, he added, \\'Let us have supper without waiting for him.Serve up whatever you please, for there is no one to give you orders;hitherto I have never left you to yourselves. But on this occasionimagine that you are our hosts, and that I and the company are yourguests; treat us well, and then we shall commend you.\\' After this,supper was served, but still no Socrates; and during the meal Agathonseveral times expressed a wish to send for him, but Aristodemusobjected; and at last when the feast was about half over--for the fit,as usual, was not of long duration--Socrates entered. Agathon, who wasreclining alone at the end of the table, begged that he would takethe place next to him; that \\'I may touch you,\\' he said, \\'and have thebenefit of that wise thought which came into your mind in the portico,and is now in your possession; for I am certain that you would not havecome away until you had found what you sought.\\'How I wish, said Socrates, taking his place as he was desired, thatwisdom could be infused by touch, out of the fuller into the emptierman, as water runs through wool out of a fuller cup into an emptier one;if that were so, how greatly should I value the privilege of recliningat your side! For you would have filled me full with a stream of wisdomplenteous and fair; whereas my own is of a very mean and questionablesort, no better than a dream. But yours is bright and full of promise,and was manifested forth in all the splendour of youth the day beforeyesterday, in the presence of more than thirty thousand Hellenes.You are mocking, Socrates, said Agathon, and ere long you and I willhave to determine who bears off the palm of wisdom--of this Dionysusshall be the judge; but at present you are better occupied with supper.Socrates took his place on the couch, and supped with the rest; and thenlibations were offered, and after a hymn had been sung to the god,and there had been the usual ceremonies, they were about to commencedrinking, when Pausanias said, And now, my friends, how can we drinkwith least injury to ourselves? I can assure you that I feel severelythe effect of yesterday\\'s potations, and must have time to recover; andI suspect that most of you are in the same predicament, for you wereof the party yesterday. Consider then: How can the drinking be madeeasiest?I entirely agree, said Aristophanes, that we should, by all means, avoidhard drinking, for I was myself one of those who were yesterday drownedin drink.I think that you are right, said Eryximachus, the son of Acumenus; butI should still like to hear one other person speak: Is Agathon able todrink hard?I am not equal to it, said Agathon.Then, said Eryximachus, the weak heads like myself, Aristodemus,Phaedrus, and others who never can drink, are fortunate in findingthat the stronger ones are not in a drinking mood. (I do not includeSocrates, who is able either to drink or to abstain, and will not mind,whichever we do.) Well, as of none of the company seem disposed to drinkmuch, I may be forgiven for saying, as a physician, that drinking deepis a bad practice, which I never follow, if I can help, and certainlydo not recommend to another, least of all to any one who still feels theeffects of yesterday\\'s carouse.I always do what you advise, and especially what you prescribe as aphysician, rejoined Phaedrus the Myrrhinusian, and the rest of thecompany, if they are wise, will do the same.It was agreed that drinking was not to be the order of the day, but thatthey were all to drink only so much as they pleased.Then, said Eryximachus, as you are all agreed that drinking is to bevoluntary, and that there is to be no compulsion, I move, in the nextplace, that the flute-girl, who has just made her appearance, be toldto go away and play to herself, or, if she likes, to the women who arewithin (compare Prot.). To-day let us have conversation instead; and,if you will allow me, I will tell you what sort of conversation. Thisproposal having been accepted, Eryximachus proceeded as follows:--I will begin, he said, after the manner of Melanippe in Euripides,\\'Not mine the word\\'which I am about to speak, but that of Phaedrus. For often he says to mein an indignant tone:--\\'What a strange thing it is, Eryximachus, that,whereas other gods have poems and hymns made in their honour, the greatand glorious god, Love, has no encomiast among all the poets who areso many. There are the worthy sophists too--the excellent Prodicus forexample, who have descanted in prose on the virtues of Heracles andother heroes; and, what is still more extraordinary, I have met with aphilosophical work in which the utility of salt has been made the themeof an eloquent discourse; and many other like things have had a likehonour bestowed upon them. And only to think that there should have beenan eager interest created about them, and yet that to this day no onehas ever dared worthily to hymn Love\\'s praises! So entirely has thisgreat deity been neglected.\\' Now in this Phaedrus seems to me to bequite right, and therefore I want to offer him a contribution; also Ithink that at the present moment we who are here assembled cannot dobetter than honour the god Love. If you agree with me, there will beno lack of conversation; for I mean to propose that each of us in turn,going from left to right, shall make a speech in honour of Love. Let himgive us the best which he can; and Phaedrus, because he is sitting firston the left hand, and because he is the father of the thought, shallbegin.No one will vote against you, Eryximachus, said Socrates. How can Ioppose your motion, who profess to understand nothing but matters oflove; nor, I presume, will Agathon and Pausanias; and there can beno doubt of Aristophanes, whose whole concern is with Dionysus andAphrodite; nor will any one disagree of those whom I see around me. Theproposal, as I am aware, may seem rather hard upon us whose place islast; but we shall be contented if we hear some good speeches first. LetPhaedrus begin the praise of Love, and good luck to him. All the companyexpressed their assent, and desired him to do as Socrates bade him.Aristodemus did not recollect all that was said, nor do I recollect allthat he related to me; but I will tell you what I thought most worthy ofremembrance, and what the chief speakers said.Phaedrus began by affirming that Love is a mighty god, and wonderfulamong gods and men, but especially wonderful in his birth. For he is theeldest of the gods, which is an honour to him; and a proof of his claimto this honour is, that of his parents there is no memorial; neitherpoet nor prose-writer has ever affirmed that he had any. As Hesiodsays:--\\'First Chaos came, and then broad-bosomed Earth, The everlasting seat ofall that is, And Love.\\'In other words, after Chaos, the Earth and Love, these two, came intobeing. Also Parmenides sings of Generation:\\'First in the train of gods, he fashioned Love.\\'And Acusilaus agrees with Hesiod. Thus numerous are the witnesses whoacknowledge Love to be the eldest of the gods. And not only is he theeldest, he is also the source of the greatest benefits to us. For I knownot any greater blessing to a young man who is beginning life than avirtuous lover, or to the lover than a beloved youth. For the principlewhich ought to be the guide of men who would nobly live--that principle,I say, neither kindred, nor honour, nor wealth, nor any other motive isable to implant so well as love. Of what am I speaking? Of the sense ofhonour and dishonour, without which neither states nor individuals everdo any good or great work. And I say that a lover who is detected indoing any dishonourable act, or submitting through cowardice whenany dishonour is done to him by another, will be more pained at beingdetected by his beloved than at being seen by his father, or by hiscompanions, or by any one else. The beloved too, when he is found inany disgraceful situation, has the same feeling about his lover. And ifthere were only some way of contriving that a state or an army should bemade up of lovers and their loves (compare Rep.), they would be the verybest governors of their own city, abstaining from all dishonour, andemulating one another in honour; and when fighting at each other\\'s side,although a mere handful, they would overcome the world. For what loverwould not choose rather to be seen by all mankind than by his beloved,either when abandoning his post or throwing away his arms? He would beready to die a thousand deaths rather than endure this. Or who woulddesert his beloved or fail him in the hour of danger? The veriest cowardwould become an inspired hero, equal to the bravest, at such a time;Love would inspire him. That courage which, as Homer says, the godbreathes into the souls of some heroes, Love of his own nature infusesinto the lover.Love will make men dare to die for their beloved--love alone; and womenas well as men. Of this, Alcestis, the daughter of Pelias, is a monumentto all Hellas; for she was willing to lay down her life on behalf of herhusband, when no one else would, although he had a father and mother;but the tenderness of her love so far exceeded theirs, that she madethem seem to be strangers in blood to their own son, and in name onlyrelated to him; and so noble did this action of hers appear to the gods,as well as to men, that among the many who have done virtuously she isone of the very few to whom, in admiration of her noble action, theyhave granted the privilege of returning alive to earth; such exceedinghonour is paid by the gods to the devotion and virtue of love. ButOrpheus, the son of Oeagrus, the harper, they sent empty away, andpresented to him an apparition only of her whom he sought, but herselfthey would not give up, because he showed no spirit; he was only aharp-player, and did not dare like Alcestis to die for love, but wascontriving how he might enter Hades alive; moreover, they afterwardscaused him to suffer death at the hands of women, as the punishmentof his cowardliness. Very different was the reward of the true love ofAchilles towards his lover Patroclus--his lover and not his love (thenotion that Patroclus was the beloved one is a foolish error into whichAeschylus has fallen, for Achilles was surely the fairer of the two,fairer also than all the other heroes; and, as Homer informs us, he wasstill beardless, and younger far). And greatly as the gods honour thevirtue of love, still the return of love on the part of the beloved tothe lover is more admired and valued and rewarded by them, for the loveris more divine; because he is inspired by God. Now Achilles was quiteaware, for he had been told by his mother, that he might avoid death andreturn home, and live to a good old age, if he abstained from slayingHector. Nevertheless he gave his life to revenge his friend, and daredto die, not only in his defence, but after he was dead. Wherefore thegods honoured him even above Alcestis, and sent him to the Islands ofthe Blest. These are my reasons for affirming that Love is the eldestand noblest and mightiest of the gods; and the chiefest author and giverof virtue in life, and of happiness after death.This, or something like this, was the speech of Phaedrus; and some otherspeeches followed which Aristodemus did not remember; the next which herepeated was that of Pausanias. Phaedrus, he said, the argument has notbeen set before us, I think, quite in the right form;--we should not becalled upon to praise Love in such an indiscriminate manner. If therewere only one Love, then what you said would be well enough; but sincethere are more Loves than one,--should have begun by determining whichof them was to be the theme of our praises. I will amend this defect;and first of all I will tell you which Love is deserving of praise, andthen try to hymn the praiseworthy one in a manner worthy of him. For weall know that Love is inseparable from Aphrodite, and if there wereonly one Aphrodite there would be only one Love; but as there are twogoddesses there must be two Loves. And am I not right in asserting thatthere are two goddesses? The elder one, having no mother, who is calledthe heavenly Aphrodite--she is the daughter of Uranus; the younger, whois the daughter of Zeus and Dione--her we call common; and the Lovewho is her fellow-worker is rightly named common, as the other love iscalled heavenly. All the gods ought to have praise given to them, butnot without distinction of their natures; and therefore I must try todistinguish the characters of the two Loves. Now actions vary accordingto the manner of their performance. Take, for example, that which weare now doing, drinking, singing and talking--these actions are not inthemselves either good or evil, but they turn out in this or that wayaccording to the mode of performing them; and when well done they aregood, and when wrongly done they are evil; and in like manner not everylove, but only that which has a noble purpose, is noble and worthyof praise. The Love who is the offspring of the common Aphrodite isessentially common, and has no discrimination, being such as the meanersort of men feel, and is apt to be of women as well as of youths, andis of the body rather than of the soul--the most foolish beings are theobjects of this love which desires only to gain an end, but never thinksof accomplishing the end nobly, and therefore does good and evil quiteindiscriminately. The goddess who is his mother is far younger thanthe other, and she was born of the union of the male and female, andpartakes of both. But the offspring of the heavenly Aphrodite is derivedfrom a mother in whose birth the female has no part,--she is from themale only; this is that love which is of youths, and the goddess beingolder, there is nothing of wantonness in her. Those who are inspired bythis love turn to the male, and delight in him who is the more valiantand intelligent nature; any one may recognise the pure enthusiasts inthe very character of their attachments. For they love not boys, butintelligent beings whose reason is beginning to be developed, much aboutthe time at which their beards begin to grow. And in choosing young mento be their companions, they mean to be faithful to them, and pass theirwhole life in company with them, not to take them in their inexperience,and deceive them, and play the fool with them, or run away from one toanother of them. But the love of young boys should be forbidden by law,because their future is uncertain; they may turn out good or bad, eitherin body or soul, and much noble enthusiasm may be thrown away upon them;in this matter the good are a law to themselves, and the coarser sortof lovers ought to be restrained by force; as we restrain or attempt torestrain them from fixing their affections on women of free birth. Theseare the persons who bring a reproach on love; and some have been led todeny the lawfulness of such attachments because they see the improprietyand evil of them; for surely nothing that is decorously and lawfullydone can justly be censured. Now here and in Lacedaemon the rules aboutlove are perplexing, but in most cities they are simple and easilyintelligible; in Elis and Boeotia, and in countries having no gifts ofeloquence, they are very straightforward; the law is simply in favour ofthese connexions, and no one, whether young or old, has anything to sayto their discredit; the reason being, as I suppose, that they are menof few words in those parts, and therefore the lovers do not like thetrouble of pleading their suit. In Ionia and other places, and generallyin countries which are subject to the barbarians, the custom is heldto be dishonourable; loves of youths share the evil repute in whichphilosophy and gymnastics are held, because they are inimical totyranny; for the interests of rulers require that their subjects shouldbe poor in spirit (compare Arist. Politics), and that there should be nostrong bond of friendship or society among them, which love, above allother motives, is likely to inspire, as our Athenian tyrants learned byexperience; for the love of Aristogeiton and the constancy of Harmodiushad a strength which undid their power. And, therefore, the ill-reputeinto which these attachments have fallen is to be ascribed to the evilcondition of those who make them to be ill-reputed; that is to say, tothe self-seeking of the governors and the cowardice of the governed; onthe other hand, the indiscriminate honour which is given to them in somecountries is attributable to the laziness of those who hold this opinionof them. In our own country a far better principle prevails, but, asI was saying, the explanation of it is rather perplexing. For, observethat open loves are held to be more honourable than secret ones, andthat the love of the noblest and highest, even if their persons areless beautiful than others, is especially honourable. Consider, too,how great is the encouragement which all the world gives to the lover;neither is he supposed to be doing anything dishonourable; but if hesucceeds he is praised, and if he fail he is blamed. And in the pursuitof his love the custom of mankind allows him to do many strange things,which philosophy would bitterly censure if they were done from anymotive of interest, or wish for office or power. He may pray, andentreat, and supplicate, and swear, and lie on a mat at the door, andendure a slavery worse than that of any slave--in any other case friendsand enemies would be equally ready to prevent him, but now there is nofriend who will be ashamed of him and admonish him, and no enemy willcharge him with meanness or flattery; the actions of a lover have agrace which ennobles them; and custom has decided that they are highlycommendable and that there no loss of character in them; and, what isstrangest of all, he only may swear and forswear himself (so men say),and the gods will forgive his transgression, for there is no such thingas a lover\\'s oath. Such is the entire liberty which gods and men haveallowed the lover, according to the custom which prevails in our part ofthe world. From this point of view a man fairly argues that in Athensto love and to be loved is held to be a very honourable thing. But whenparents forbid their sons to talk with their lovers, and place themunder a tutor\\'s care, who is appointed to see to these things, and theircompanions and equals cast in their teeth anything of the sort whichthey may observe, and their elders refuse to silence the reproversand do not rebuke them--any one who reflects on all this will, on thecontrary, think that we hold these practices to be most disgraceful.But, as I was saying at first, the truth as I imagine is, that whethersuch practices are honourable or whether they are dishonourable is not asimple question; they are honourable to him who follows them honourably,dishonourable to him who follows them dishonourably. There is dishonourin yielding to the evil, or in an evil manner; but there is honour inyielding to the good, or in an honourable manner. Evil is the vulgarlover who loves the body rather than the soul, inasmuch as he is noteven stable, because he loves a thing which is in itself unstable, andtherefore when the bloom of youth which he was desiring is over, hetakes wing and flies away, in spite of all his words and promises;whereas the love of the noble disposition is life-long, for it becomesone with the everlasting. The custom of our country would have both ofthem proven well and truly, and would have us yield to the one sort oflover and avoid the other, and therefore encourages some to pursue,and others to fly; testing both the lover and beloved in contests andtrials, until they show to which of the two classes they respectivelybelong. And this is the reason why, in the first place, a hastyattachment is held to be dishonourable, because time is the true test ofthis as of most other things; and secondly there is a dishonour in beingovercome by the love of money, or of wealth, or of political power,whether a man is frightened into surrender by the loss of them, or,having experienced the benefits of money and political corruption, isunable to rise above the seductions of them. For none of these thingsare of a permanent or lasting nature; not to mention that no generousfriendship ever sprang from them. There remains, then, only one way ofhonourable attachment which custom allows in the beloved, and this isthe way of virtue; for as we admitted that any service which the loverdoes to him is not to be accounted flattery or a dishonour to himself,so the beloved has one way only of voluntary service which is notdishonourable, and this is virtuous service.For we have a custom, and according to our custom any one who doesservice to another under the idea that he will be improved by him eitherin wisdom, or in some other particular of virtue--such a voluntaryservice, I say, is not to be regarded as a dishonour, and is not opento the charge of flattery. And these two customs, one the love of youth,and the other the practice of philosophy and virtue in general, ought tomeet in one, and then the beloved may honourably indulge the lover. Forwhen the lover and beloved come together, having each of them a law, andthe lover thinks that he is right in doing any service which he can tohis gracious loving one; and the other that he is right in showing anykindness which he can to him who is making him wise and good; the onecapable of communicating wisdom and virtue, the other seeking to acquirethem with a view to education and wisdom, when the two laws of love arefulfilled and meet in one--then, and then only, may the beloved yieldwith honour to the lover. Nor when love is of this disinterested sort isthere any disgrace in being deceived, but in every other case there isequal disgrace in being or not being deceived. For he who is gracious tohis lover under the impression that he is rich, and is disappointed ofhis gains because he turns out to be poor, is disgraced all the same:for he has done his best to show that he would give himself up to anyone\\'s \\'uses base\\' for the sake of money; but this is not honourable. Andon the same principle he who gives himself to a lover because he is agood man, and in the hope that he will be improved by his company, showshimself to be virtuous, even though the object of his affection turnout to be a villain, and to have no virtue; and if he is deceived he hascommitted a noble error. For he has proved that for his part he will doanything for anybody with a view to virtue and improvement, than whichthere can be nothing nobler. Thus noble in every case is the acceptanceof another for the sake of virtue. This is that love which is thelove of the heavenly godess, and is heavenly, and of great price toindividuals and cities, making the lover and the beloved alike eager inthe work of their own improvement. But all other loves are the offspringof the other, who is the common goddess. To you, Phaedrus, I offer thismy contribution in praise of love, which is as good as I could makeextempore.Pausanias came to a pause--this is the balanced way in which I havebeen taught by the wise to speak; and Aristodemus said that the turn ofAristophanes was next, but either he had eaten too much, or from someother cause he had the hiccough, and was obliged to change turns withEryximachus the physician, who was reclining on the couch below him.Eryximachus, he said, you ought either to stop my hiccough, or to speakin my turn until I have left off.I will do both, said Eryximachus: I will speak in your turn, and do youspeak in mine; and while I am speaking let me recommend you to hold yourbreath, and if after you have done so for some time the hiccough isno better, then gargle with a little water; and if it still continues,tickle your nose with something and sneeze; and if you sneeze once ortwice, even the most violent hiccough is sure to go. I will do as youprescribe, said Aristophanes, and now get on.Eryximachus spoke as follows: Seeing that Pausanias made a fairbeginning, and but a lame ending, I must endeavour to supply hisdeficiency. I think that he has rightly distinguished two kinds of love.But my art further informs me that the double love is not merely anaffection of the soul of man towards the fair, or towards anything, butis to be found in the bodies of all animals and in productions of theearth, and I may say in all that is; such is the conclusion which I seemto have gathered from my own art of medicine, whence I learn how greatand wonderful and universal is the deity of love, whose empire extendsover all things, divine as well as human. And from medicine I will beginthat I may do honour to my art. There are in the human body these twokinds of love, which are confessedly different and unlike, and beingunlike, they have loves and desires which are unlike; and the desire ofthe healthy is one, and the desire of the diseased is another; and asPausanias was just now saying that to indulge good men is honourable,and bad men dishonourable:--so too in the body the good and healthyelements are to be indulged, and the bad elements and the elements ofdisease are not to be indulged, but discouraged. And this is what thephysician has to do, and in this the art of medicine consists: formedicine may be regarded generally as the knowledge of the loves anddesires of the body, and how to satisfy them or not; and the bestphysician is he who is able to separate fair love from foul, or toconvert one into the other; and he who knows how to eradicate and how toimplant love, whichever is required, and can reconcile the most hostileelements in the constitution and make them loving friends, is a skilfulpractitioner. Now the most hostile are the most opposite, such ashot and cold, bitter and sweet, moist and dry, and the like. And myancestor, Asclepius, knowing how to implant friendship and accord inthese elements, was the creator of our art, as our friends the poetshere tell us, and I believe them; and not only medicine in every branchbut the arts of gymnastic and husbandry are under his dominion. Any onewho pays the least attention to the subject will also perceive that inmusic there is the same reconciliation of opposites; and I suppose thatthis must have been the meaning of Heracleitus, although his words arenot accurate; for he says that The One is united by disunion, like theharmony of the bow and the lyre. Now there is an absurdity saying thatharmony is discord or is composed of elements which are still in a stateof discord. But what he probably meant was, that harmony is composed ofdiffering notes of higher or lower pitch which disagreed once, but arenow reconciled by the art of music; for if the higher and lower notesstill disagreed, there could be no harmony,--clearly not. For harmonyis a symphony, and symphony is an agreement; but an agreement ofdisagreements while they disagree there cannot be; you cannot harmonizethat which disagrees. In like manner rhythm is compounded of elementsshort and long, once differing and now in accord; which accordance, asin the former instance, medicine, so in all these other cases, musicimplants, making love and unison to grow up among them; and thus music,too, is concerned with the principles of love in their application toharmony and rhythm. Again, in the essential nature of harmony and rhythmthere is no difficulty in discerning love which has not yet becomedouble. But when you want to use them in actual life, either in thecomposition of songs or in the correct performance of airs or metrescomposed already, which latter is called education, then the difficultybegins, and the good artist is needed. Then the old tale has to berepeated of fair and heavenly love--the love of Urania the fair andheavenly muse, and of the duty of accepting the temperate, and thosewho are as yet intemperate only that they may become temperate, and ofpreserving their love; and again, of the vulgar Polyhymnia, who mustbe used with circumspection that the pleasure be enjoyed, but may notgenerate licentiousness; just as in my own art it is a great matter soto regulate the desires of the epicure that he may gratify his tasteswithout the attendant evil of disease. Whence I infer that in music, inmedicine, in all other things human as well as divine, both loves oughtto be noted as far as may be, for they are both present.The course of the seasons is also full of both these principles; andwhen, as I was saying, the elements of hot and cold, moist and dry,attain the harmonious love of one another and blend in temperance andharmony, they bring to men, animals, and plants health and plenty, anddo them no harm; whereas the wanton love, getting the upper hand andaffecting the seasons of the year, is very destructive and injurious,being the source of pestilence, and bringing many other kinds ofdiseases on animals and plants; for hoar-frost and hail and blightspring from the excesses and disorders of these elements of love, whichto know in relation to the revolutions of the heavenly bodies and theseasons of the year is termed astronomy. Furthermore all sacrifices andthe whole province of divination, which is the art of communion betweengods and men--these, I say, are concerned only with the preservationof the good and the cure of the evil love. For all manner of impiety islikely to ensue if, instead of accepting and honouring and reverencingthe harmonious love in all his actions, a man honours the other love,whether in his feelings towards gods or parents, towards the living orthe dead. Wherefore the business of divination is to see to these lovesand to heal them, and divination is the peacemaker of gods and men,working by a knowledge of the religious or irreligious tendencies whichexist in human loves. Such is the great and mighty, or rather omnipotentforce of love in general. And the love, more especially, which isconcerned with the good, and which is perfected in company withtemperance and justice, whether among gods or men, has the greatestpower, and is the source of all our happiness and harmony, and makes usfriends with the gods who are above us, and with one another. I dare saythat I too have omitted several things which might be said in praiseof Love, but this was not intentional, and you, Aristophanes, may nowsupply the omission or take some other line of commendation; for Iperceive that you are rid of the hiccough.Yes, said Aristophanes, who followed, the hiccough is gone; not,however, until I applied the sneezing; and I wonder whether the harmonyof the body has a love of such noises and ticklings, for I no soonerapplied the sneezing than I was cured.Eryximachus said: Beware, friend Aristophanes, although you are goingto speak, you are making fun of me; and I shall have to watch and seewhether I cannot have a laugh at your expense, when you might speak inpeace.You are right, said Aristophanes, laughing. I will unsay my words; butdo you please not to watch me, as I fear that in the speech which Iam about to make, instead of others laughing with me, which is to themanner born of our muse and would be all the better, I shall only belaughed at by them.Do you expect to shoot your bolt and escape, Aristophanes? Well, perhapsif you are very careful and bear in mind that you will be called toaccount, I may be induced to let you off.Aristophanes professed to open another vein of discourse; he had amind to praise Love in another way, unlike that either of Pausanias orEryximachus. Mankind, he said, judging by their neglect of him, havenever, as I think, at all understood the power of Love. For if they hadunderstood him they would surely have built noble temples and altars,and offered solemn sacrifices in his honour; but this is not done, andmost certainly ought to be done: since of all the gods he is the bestfriend of men, the helper and the healer of the ills which are the greatimpediment to the happiness of the race. I will try to describe hispower to you, and you shall teach the rest of the world what I amteaching you. In the first place, let me treat of the nature of man andwhat has happened to it; for the original human nature was not likethe present, but different. The sexes were not two as they are now, butoriginally three in number; there was man, woman, and the union of thetwo, having a name corresponding to this double nature, which had oncea real existence, but is now lost, and the word \\'Androgynous\\' is onlypreserved as a term of reproach. In the second place, the primeval manwas round, his back and sides forming a circle; and he had four handsand four feet, one head with two faces, looking opposite ways, set on around neck and precisely alike; also four ears, two privy members,and the remainder to correspond. He could walk upright as men now do,backwards or forwards as he pleased, and he could also roll over andover at a great pace, turning on his four hands and four feet, eight inall, like tumblers going over and over with their legs in the air; thiswas when he wanted to run fast. Now the sexes were three, and such as Ihave described them; because the sun, moon, and earth are three; and theman was originally the child of the sun, the woman of the earth, and theman-woman of the moon, which is made up of sun and earth, and they wereall round and moved round and round like their parents. Terrible wastheir might and strength, and the thoughts of their hearts were great,and they made an attack upon the gods; of them is told the tale of Otysand Ephialtes who, as Homer says, dared to scale heaven, and wouldhave laid hands upon the gods. Doubt reigned in the celestial councils.Should they kill them and annihilate the race with thunderbolts, as theyhad done the giants, then there would be an end of the sacrifices andworship which men offered to them; but, on the other hand, the godscould not suffer their insolence to be unrestrained. At last, after agood deal of reflection, Zeus discovered a way. He said: \\'Methinks Ihave a plan which will humble their pride and improve their manners; menshall continue to exist, but I will cut them in two and then they willbe diminished in strength and increased in numbers; this will have theadvantage of making them more profitable to us. They shall walk uprighton two legs, and if they continue insolent and will not be quiet, I willsplit them again and they shall hop about on a single leg.\\' He spoke andcut men in two, like a sorb-apple which is halved for pickling, oras you might divide an egg with a hair; and as he cut them one afteranother, he bade Apollo give the face and the half of the neck a turnin order that the man might contemplate the section of himself: he wouldthus learn a lesson of humility. Apollo was also bidden to heal theirwounds and compose their forms. So he gave a turn to the face and pulledthe skin from the sides all over that which in our language is calledthe belly, like the purses which draw in, and he made one mouth atthe centre, which he fastened in a knot (the same which is called thenavel); he also moulded the breast and took out most of the wrinkles,much as a shoemaker might smooth leather upon a last; he left a few,however, in the region of the belly and navel, as a memorial of theprimeval state. After the division the two parts of man, each desiringhis other half, came together, and throwing their arms about oneanother, entwined in mutual embraces, longing to grow into one, theywere on the point of dying from hunger and self-neglect, because theydid not like to do anything apart; and when one of the halves died andthe other survived, the survivor sought another mate, man or woman aswe call them,--being the sections of entire men or women,--and clung tothat. They were being destroyed, when Zeus in pity of them invented anew plan: he turned the parts of generation round to the front, for thishad not been always their position, and they sowed the seed no longer ashitherto like grasshoppers in the ground, but in one another; and afterthe transposition the male generated in the female in order that by themutual embraces of man and woman they might breed, and the race mightcontinue; or if man came to man they might be satisfied, and rest, andgo their ways to the business of life: so ancient is the desire of oneanother which is implanted in us, reuniting our original nature, makingone of two, and healing the state of man. Each of us when separated,having one side only, like a flat fish, is but the indenture of a man,and he is always looking for his other half. Men who are a sectionof that double nature which was once called Androgynous are lovers ofwomen; adulterers are generally of this breed, and also adulterous womenwho lust after men: the women who are a section of the woman do not carefor men, but have female attachments; the female companions are of thissort. But they who are a section of the male follow the male, and whilethey are young, being slices of the original man, they hang about menand embrace them, and they are themselves the best of boys and youths,because they have the most manly nature. Some indeed assert that theyare shameless, but this is not true; for they do not act thus from anywant of shame, but because they are valiant and manly, and have a manlycountenance, and they embrace that which is like them. And these whenthey grow up become our statesmen, and these only, which is a greatproof of the truth of what I am saving. When they reach manhood theyare lovers of youth, and are not naturally inclined to marry or begetchildren,--if at all, they do so only in obedience to the law; but theyare satisfied if they may be allowed to live with one another unwedded;and such a nature is prone to love and ready to return love, alwaysembracing that which is akin to him. And when one of them meets with hisother half, the actual half of himself, whether he be a lover of youthor a lover of another sort, the pair are lost in an amazement of loveand friendship and intimacy, and one will not be out of the other\\'ssight, as I may say, even for a moment: these are the people who passtheir whole lives together; yet they could not explain what they desireof one another. For the intense yearning which each of them has towardsthe other does not appear to be the desire of lover\\'s intercourse, butof something else which the soul of either evidently desires and cannottell, and of which she has only a dark and doubtful presentiment.Suppose Hephaestus, with his instruments, to come to the pair who arelying side by side and to say to them, \\'What do you people want of oneanother?\\' they would be unable to explain. And suppose further, thatwhen he saw their perplexity he said: \\'Do you desire to be wholly one;always day and night to be in one another\\'s company? for if this is whatyou desire, I am ready to melt you into one and let you grow together,so that being two you shall become one, and while you live live a commonlife as if you were a single man, and after your death in the worldbelow still be one departed soul instead of two--I ask whether thisis what you lovingly desire, and whether you are satisfied to attainthis?\\'--there is not a man of them who when he heard the proposal woulddeny or would not acknowledge that this meeting and melting into oneanother, this becoming one instead of two, was the very expression ofhis ancient need (compare Arist. Pol.). And the reason is that humannature was originally one and we were a whole, and the desire andpursuit of the whole is called love. There was a time, I say, when wewere one, but now because of the wickedness of mankind God has dispersedus, as the Arcadians were dispersed into villages by the Lacedaemonians(compare Arist. Pol.). And if we are not obedient to the gods, there isa danger that we shall be split up again and go about in basso-relievo,like the profile figures having only half a nose which are sculpturedon monuments, and that we shall be like tallies. Wherefore let us exhortall men to piety, that we may avoid evil, and obtain the good, of whichLove is to us the lord and minister; and let no one oppose him--he isthe enemy of the gods who opposes him. For if we are friends of the Godand at peace with him we shall find our own true loves, which rarelyhappens in this world at present. I am serious, and therefore I must begEryximachus not to make fun or to find any allusion in what I am sayingto Pausanias and Agathon, who, as I suspect, are both of the manlynature, and belong to the class which I have been describing. But mywords have a wider application--they include men and women everywhere;and I believe that if our loves were perfectly accomplished, and eachone returning to his primeval nature had his original true love, thenour race would be happy. And if this would be best of all, the bestin the next degree and under present circumstances must be the nearestapproach to such an union; and that will be the attainment of acongenial love. Wherefore, if we would praise him who has given tous the benefit, we must praise the god Love, who is our greatestbenefactor, both leading us in this life back to our own nature, andgiving us high hopes for the future, for he promises that if we arepious, he will restore us to our original state, and heal us and makeus happy and blessed. This, Eryximachus, is my discourse of love, which,although different to yours, I must beg you to leave unassailed by theshafts of your ridicule, in order that each may have his turn; each, orrather either, for Agathon and Socrates are the only ones left.Indeed, I am not going to attack you, said Eryximachus, for I thoughtyour speech charming, and did I not know that Agathon and Socrates aremasters in the art of love, I should be really afraid that they wouldhave nothing to say, after the world of things which have been saidalready. But, for all that, I am not without hopes.Socrates said: You played your part well, Eryximachus; but if you wereas I am now, or rather as I shall be when Agathon has spoken, you would,indeed, be in a great strait.You want to cast a spell over me, Socrates, said Agathon, in the hopethat I may be disconcerted at the expectation raised among the audiencethat I shall speak well.I should be strangely forgetful, Agathon replied Socrates, of thecourage and magnanimity which you showed when your own compositions wereabout to be exhibited, and you came upon the stage with the actors andfaced the vast theatre altogether undismayed, if I thought that yournerves could be fluttered at a small party of friends.Do you think, Socrates, said Agathon, that my head is so full of thetheatre as not to know how much more formidable to a man of sense a fewgood judges are than many fools?Nay, replied Socrates, I should be very wrong in attributing to you,Agathon, that or any other want of refinement. And I am quite aware thatif you happened to meet with any whom you thought wise, you would carefor their opinion much more than for that of the many. But then we,having been a part of the foolish many in the theatre, cannot beregarded as the select wise; though I know that if you chanced to be inthe presence, not of one of ourselves, but of some really wise man, youwould be ashamed of disgracing yourself before him--would you not?Yes, said Agathon.But before the many you would not be ashamed, if you thought that youwere doing something disgraceful in their presence?Here Phaedrus interrupted them, saying: not answer him, my dear Agathon;for if he can only get a partner with whom he can talk, especially agood-looking one, he will no longer care about the completion of ourplan. Now I love to hear him talk; but just at present I must not forgetthe encomium on Love which I ought to receive from him and from everyone. When you and he have paid your tribute to the god, then you maytalk.Very good, Phaedrus, said Agathon; I see no reason why I should notproceed with my speech, as I shall have many other opportunities ofconversing with Socrates. Let me say first how I ought to speak, andthen speak:--The previous speakers, instead of praising the god Love, or unfoldinghis nature, appear to have congratulated mankind on the benefits whichhe confers upon them. But I would rather praise the god first, and thenspeak of his gifts; this is always the right way of praising everything.May I say without impiety or offence, that of all the blessed gods heis the most blessed because he is the fairest and best? And he is thefairest: for, in the first place, he is the youngest, and of his youthhe is himself the witness, fleeing out of the way of age, who is swiftenough, swifter truly than most of us like:--Love hates him and will notcome near him; but youth and love live and move together--like to like,as the proverb says. Many things were said by Phaedrus about Love inwhich I agree with him; but I cannot agree that he is older than Iapetusand Kronos:--not so; I maintain him to be the youngest of the gods, andyouthful ever. The ancient doings among the gods of which Hesiodand Parmenides spoke, if the tradition of them be true, were done ofNecessity and not of Love; had Love been in those days, there would havebeen no chaining or mutilation of the gods, or other violence, but peaceand sweetness, as there is now in heaven, since the rule of Love began.Love is young and also tender; he ought to have a poet like Homer todescribe his tenderness, as Homer says of Ate, that she is a goddess andtender:--\\'Her feet are tender, for she sets her steps, Not on the ground but onthe heads of men:\\'herein is an excellent proof of her tenderness,--that she walks notupon the hard but upon the soft. Let us adduce a similar proof of thetenderness of Love; for he walks not upon the earth, nor yet upon theskulls of men, which are not so very soft, but in the hearts and soulsof both gods and men, which are of all things the softest: in themhe walks and dwells and makes his home. Not in every soul withoutexception, for where there is hardness he departs, where there issoftness there he dwells; and nestling always with his feet and in allmanner of ways in the softest of soft places, how can he be other thanthe softest of all things? Of a truth he is the tenderest as well asthe youngest, and also he is of flexile form; for if he were hard andwithout flexure he could not enfold all things, or wind his way into andout of every soul of man undiscovered. And a proof of his flexibilityand symmetry of form is his grace, which is universally admitted to bein an especial manner the attribute of Love; ungrace and love are alwaysat war with one another. The fairness of his complexion is revealed byhis habitation among the flowers; for he dwells not amid bloomless orfading beauties, whether of body or soul or aught else, but in the placeof flowers and scents, there he sits and abides. Concerning the beautyof the god I have said enough; and yet there remains much more which Imight say. Of his virtue I have now to speak: his greatest glory is thathe can neither do nor suffer wrong to or from any god or any man; forhe suffers not by force if he suffers; force comes not near him, neitherwhen he acts does he act by force. For all men in all things serve himof their own free will, and where there is voluntary agreement, there,as the laws which are the lords of the city say, is justice. Andnot only is he just but exceedingly temperate, for Temperance is theacknowledged ruler of the pleasures and desires, and no pleasure evermasters Love; he is their master and they are his servants; and if heconquers them he must be temperate indeed. As to courage, even the Godof War is no match for him; he is the captive and Love is the lord,for love, the love of Aphrodite, masters him, as the tale runs; and themaster is stronger than the servant. And if he conquers the bravest ofall others, he must be himself the bravest. Of his courage and justiceand temperance I have spoken, but I have yet to speak of his wisdom; andaccording to the measure of my ability I must try to do my best. In thefirst place he is a poet (and here, like Eryximachus, I magnify my art),and he is also the source of poesy in others, which he could not be ifhe were not himself a poet. And at the touch of him every one becomesa poet, even though he had no music in him before (A fragment of theSthenoaoea of Euripides.); this also is a proof that Love is a good poetand accomplished in all the fine arts; for no one can give to anotherthat which he has not himself, or teach that of which he has noknowledge. Who will deny that the creation of the animals is his doing?Are they not all the works of his wisdom, born and begotten of him?And as to the artists, do we not know that he only of them whom loveinspires has the light of fame?--he whom Love touches not walksin darkness. The arts of medicine and archery and divination werediscovered by Apollo, under the guidance of love and desire; so that hetoo is a disciple of Love. Also the melody of the Muses, the metallurgyof Hephaestus, the weaving of Athene, the empire of Zeus over gods andmen, are all due to Love, who was the inventor of them. And so Love setin order the empire of the gods--the love of beauty, as is evident, forwith deformity Love has no concern. In the days of old, as I began bysaying, dreadful deeds were done among the gods, for they were ruledby Necessity; but now since the birth of Love, and from the Love ofthe beautiful, has sprung every good in heaven and earth. Therefore,Phaedrus, I say of Love that he is the fairest and best in himself, andthe cause of what is fairest and best in all other things. And therecomes into my mind a line of poetry in which he is said to be the godwho\\'Gives peace on earth and calms the stormy deep, Who stills the windsand bids the sufferer sleep.\\'This is he who empties men of disaffection and fills them withaffection, who makes them to meet together at banquets such as these: insacrifices, feasts, dances, he is our lord--who sends courtesy and sendsaway discourtesy, who gives kindness ever and never gives unkindness;the friend of the good, the wonder of the wise, the amazement of thegods; desired by those who have no part in him, and precious to thosewho have the better part in him; parent of delicacy, luxury, desire,fondness, softness, grace; regardful of the good, regardless of theevil: in every word, work, wish, fear--saviour, pilot, comrade, helper;glory of gods and men, leader best and brightest: in whose footstepslet every man follow, sweetly singing in his honour and joining in thatsweet strain with which love charms the souls of gods and men. Suchis the speech, Phaedrus, half-playful, yet having a certain measure ofseriousness, which, according to my ability, I dedicate to the god.When Agathon had done speaking, Aristodemus said that there was ageneral cheer; the young man was thought to have spoken in a mannerworthy of himself, and of the god. And Socrates, looking at Eryximachus,said: Tell me, son of Acumenus, was there not reason in my fears? andwas I not a true prophet when I said that Agathon would make a wonderfuloration, and that I should be in a strait?The part of the prophecy which concerns Agathon, replied Eryximachus,appears to me to be true; but not the other part--that you will be in astrait.Why, my dear friend, said Socrates, must not I or any one be in a straitwho has to speak after he has heard such a rich and varied discourse? Iam especially struck with the beauty of the concluding words--who couldlisten to them without amazement? When I reflected on the immeasurableinferiority of my own powers, I was ready to run away for shame, ifthere had been a possibility of escape. For I was reminded of Gorgias,and at the end of his speech I fancied that Agathon was shaking at methe Gorginian or Gorgonian head of the great master of rhetoric, whichwas simply to turn me and my speech into stone, as Homer says (Odyssey),and strike me dumb. And then I perceived how foolish I had been inconsenting to take my turn with you in praising love, and saying thatI too was a master of the art, when I really had no conception howanything ought to be praised. For in my simplicity I imagined that thetopics of praise should be true, and that this being presupposed, outof the true the speaker was to choose the best and set them forth in thebest manner. And I felt quite proud, thinking that I knew the nature oftrue praise, and should speak well. Whereas I now see that the intentionwas to attribute to Love every species of greatness and glory,whether really belonging to him or not, without regard to truth orfalsehood--that was no matter; for the original proposal seems to havebeen not that each of you should really praise Love, but only thatyou should appear to praise him. And so you attribute to Love everyimaginable form of praise which can be gathered anywhere; and you saythat \\'he is all this,\\' and \\'the cause of all that,\\' making him appearthe fairest and best of all to those who know him not, for you cannotimpose upon those who know him. And a noble and solemn hymn of praisehave you rehearsed. But as I misunderstood the nature of the praise whenI said that I would take my turn, I must beg to be absolved from thepromise which I made in ignorance, and which (as Euripides would say(Eurip. Hyppolytus)) was a promise of the lips and not of the mind.Farewell then to such a strain: for I do not praise in that way; no,indeed, I cannot. But if you like to hear the truth about love, Iam ready to speak in my own manner, though I will not make myselfridiculous by entering into any rivalry with you. Say then, Phaedrus,whether you would like to have the truth about love, spoken in any wordsand in any order which may happen to come into my mind at the time. Willthat be agreeable to you?Aristodemus said that Phaedrus and the company bid him speak inany manner which he thought best. Then, he added, let me have yourpermission first to ask Agathon a few more questions, in order that Imay take his admissions as the premisses of my discourse.I grant the permission, said Phaedrus: put your questions. Socrates thenproceeded as follows:--In the magnificent oration which you have just uttered, I think that youwere right, my dear Agathon, in proposing to speak of the nature of Lovefirst and afterwards of his works--that is a way of beginning which Ivery much approve. And as you have spoken so eloquently of his nature,may I ask you further, Whether love is the love of something or ofnothing? And here I must explain myself: I do not want you to say thatlove is the love of a father or the love of a mother--that would beridiculous; but to answer as you would, if I asked is a father a fatherof something? to which you would find no difficulty in replying, of ason or daughter: and the answer would be right.Very true, said Agathon.And you would say the same of a mother?He assented.Yet let me ask you one more question in order to illustrate my meaning:Is not a brother to be regarded essentially as a brother of something?Certainly, he replied.That is, of a brother or sister?Yes, he said.And now, said Socrates, I will ask about Love:--Is Love of something orof nothing?Of something, surely, he replied.Keep in mind what this is, and tell me what I want to know--whether Lovedesires that of which love is.Yes, surely.And does he possess, or does he not possess, that which he loves anddesires?Probably not, I should say.Nay, replied Socrates, I would have you consider whether \\'necessarily\\'is not rather the word. The inference that he who desires somethingis in want of something, and that he who desires nothing is in want ofnothing, is in my judgment, Agathon, absolutely and necessarily true.What do you think?I agree with you, said Agathon.Very good. Would he who is great, desire to be great, or he who isstrong, desire to be strong?That would be inconsistent with our previous admissions.True. For he who is anything cannot want to be that which he is?Very true.And yet, added Socrates, if a man being strong desired to be strong, orbeing swift desired to be swift, or being healthy desired to be healthy,in that case he might be thought to desire something which he alreadyhas or is. I give the example in order that we may avoid misconception.For the possessors of these qualities, Agathon, must be supposed to havetheir respective advantages at the time, whether they choose or not; andwho can desire that which he has? Therefore, when a person says, I amwell and wish to be well, or I am rich and wish to be rich, and I desiresimply to have what I have--to him we shall reply: \\'You, my friend,having wealth and health and strength, want to have the continuance ofthem; for at this moment, whether you choose or no, you have them. Andwhen you say, I desire that which I have and nothing else, is not yourmeaning that you want to have what you now have in the future?\\' He mustagree with us--must he not?He must, replied Agathon.Then, said Socrates, he desires that what he has at present may bepreserved to him in the future, which is equivalent to saying that hedesires something which is non-existent to him, and which as yet he hasnot got:Very true, he said.Then he and every one who desires, desires that which he has notalready, and which is future and not present, and which he has not, andis not, and of which he is in want;--these are the sort of things whichlove and desire seek?Very true, he said.Then now, said Socrates, let us recapitulate the argument. First, is notlove of something, and of something too which is wanting to a man?Yes, he replied.Remember further what you said in your speech, or if you do not rememberI will remind you: you said that the love of the beautiful set inorder the empire of the gods, for that of deformed things there is nolove--did you not say something of that kind?Yes, said Agathon.Yes, my friend, and the remark was a just one. And if this is true, Loveis the love of beauty and not of deformity?He assented.And the admission has been already made that Love is of something whicha man wants and has not?True, he said.Then Love wants and has not beauty?Certainly, he replied.And would you call that beautiful which wants and does not possessbeauty?Certainly not.Then would you still say that love is beautiful?Agathon replied: I fear that I did not understand what I was saying.You made a very good speech, Agathon, replied Socrates; but there isyet one small question which I would fain ask:--Is not the good also thebeautiful?Yes.Then in wanting the beautiful, love wants also the good?I cannot refute you, Socrates, said Agathon:--Let us assume that whatyou say is true.Say rather, beloved Agathon, that you cannot refute the truth; forSocrates is easily refuted.And now, taking my leave of you, I would rehearse a tale of love which Iheard from Diotima of Mantineia (compare 1 Alcibiades), a woman wise inthis and in many other kinds of knowledge, who in the days of old, whenthe Athenians offered sacrifice before the coming of the plague, delayedthe disease ten years. She was my instructress in the art of love, andI shall repeat to you what she said to me, beginning with the admissionsmade by Agathon, which are nearly if not quite the same which I madeto the wise woman when she questioned me: I think that this will bethe easiest way, and I shall take both parts myself as well as I can(compare Gorgias). As you, Agathon, suggested (supra), I must speakfirst of the being and nature of Love, and then of his works. First Isaid to her in nearly the same words which he used to me, that Love wasa mighty god, and likewise fair; and she proved to me as I proved to himthat, by my own showing, Love was neither fair nor good. \\'What do youmean, Diotima,\\' I said, \\'is love then evil and foul?\\' \\'Hush,\\' she cried;\\'must that be foul which is not fair?\\' \\'Certainly,\\' I said. \\'And is thatwhich is not wise, ignorant? do you not see that there is a mean betweenwisdom and ignorance?\\' \\'And what may that be?\\' I said. \\'Right opinion,\\'she replied; \\'which, as you know, being incapable of giving a reason,is not knowledge (for how can knowledge be devoid of reason? nor again,ignorance, for neither can ignorance attain the truth), but is clearlysomething which is a mean between ignorance and wisdom.\\' \\'Quite true,\\'I replied. \\'Do not then insist,\\' she said, \\'that what is not fair is ofnecessity foul, or what is not good evil; or infer that because loveis not fair and good he is therefore foul and evil; for he is in a meanbetween them.\\' \\'Well,\\' I said, \\'Love is surely admitted by all to be agreat god.\\' \\'By those who know or by those who do not know?\\' \\'By all.\\'\\'And how, Socrates,\\' she said with a smile, \\'can Love be acknowledged tobe a great god by those who say that he is not a god at all?\\' \\'And whoare they?\\' I said. \\'You and I are two of them,\\' she replied. \\'How canthat be?\\' I said. \\'It is quite intelligible,\\' she replied; \\'for youyourself would acknowledge that the gods are happy and fair--of courseyou would--would you dare to say that any god was not?\\' \\'Certainly not,\\'I replied. \\'And you mean by the happy, those who are the possessors ofthings good or fair?\\' \\'Yes.\\' \\'And you admitted that Love, because hewas in want, desires those good and fair things of which he is in want?\\'\\'Yes, I did.\\' \\'But how can he be a god who has no portion in what iseither good or fair?\\' \\'Impossible.\\' \\'Then you see that you also deny thedivinity of Love.\\'\\'What then is Love?\\' I asked; \\'Is he mortal?\\' \\'No.\\' \\'What then?\\' \\'As inthe former instance, he is neither mortal nor immortal, but in a meanbetween the two.\\' \\'What is he, Diotima?\\' \\'He is a great spirit (daimon),and like all spirits he is intermediate between the divine and themortal.\\' \\'And what,\\' I said, \\'is his power?\\' \\'He interprets,\\' shereplied, \\'between gods and men, conveying and taking across to the godsthe prayers and sacrifices of men, and to men the commands and repliesof the gods; he is the mediator who spans the chasm which divides them,and therefore in him all is bound together, and through him the arts ofthe prophet and the priest, their sacrifices and mysteries and charms,and all prophecy and incantation, find their way. For God mingles notwith man; but through Love all the intercourse and converse of Godwith man, whether awake or asleep, is carried on. The wisdom whichunderstands this is spiritual; all other wisdom, such as that of artsand handicrafts, is mean and vulgar. Now these spirits or intermediatepowers are many and diverse, and one of them is Love.\\' \\'And who,\\' Isaid, \\'was his father, and who his mother?\\' \\'The tale,\\' she said, \\'willtake time; nevertheless I will tell you. On the birthday of Aphroditethere was a feast of the gods, at which the god Poros or Plenty, who isthe son of Metis or Discretion, was one of the guests. When the feastwas over, Penia or Poverty, as the manner is on such occasions, cameabout the doors to beg. Now Plenty who was the worse for nectar (therewas no wine in those days), went into the garden of Zeus and fell intoa heavy sleep, and Poverty considering her own straitened circumstances,plotted to have a child by him, and accordingly she lay down at his sideand conceived Love, who partly because he is naturally a lover of thebeautiful, and because Aphrodite is herself beautiful, and also becausehe was born on her birthday, is her follower and attendant. And as hisparentage is, so also are his fortunes. In the first place he is alwayspoor, and anything but tender and fair, as the many imagine him; and heis rough and squalid, and has no shoes, nor a house to dwell in; on thebare earth exposed he lies under the open heaven, in the streets, or atthe doors of houses, taking his rest; and like his mother he is alwaysin distress. Like his father too, whom he also partly resembles, he isalways plotting against the fair and good; he is bold, enterprising,strong, a mighty hunter, always weaving some intrigue or other, keen inthe pursuit of wisdom, fertile in resources; a philosopher at all times,terrible as an enchanter, sorcerer, sophist. He is by nature neithermortal nor immortal, but alive and flourishing at one moment when he isin plenty, and dead at another moment, and again alive by reason of hisfather\\'s nature. But that which is always flowing in is always flowingout, and so he is never in want and never in wealth; and, further, heis in a mean between ignorance and knowledge. The truth of the matteris this: No god is a philosopher or seeker after wisdom, for he is wisealready; nor does any man who is wise seek after wisdom. Neither do theignorant seek after wisdom. For herein is the evil of ignorance, that hewho is neither good nor wise is nevertheless satisfied with himself:he has no desire for that of which he feels no want.\\' \\'But who then,Diotima,\\' I said, \\'are the lovers of wisdom, if they are neither thewise nor the foolish?\\' \\'A child may answer that question,\\' she replied;\\'they are those who are in a mean between the two; Love is one of them.For wisdom is a most beautiful thing, and Love is of the beautiful; andtherefore Love is also a philosopher or lover of wisdom, and being alover of wisdom is in a mean between the wise and the ignorant. And ofthis too his birth is the cause; for his father is wealthy and wise, andhis mother poor and foolish. Such, my dear Socrates, is the nature ofthe spirit Love. The error in your conception of him was very natural,and as I imagine from what you say, has arisen out of a confusion oflove and the beloved, which made you think that love was all beautiful.For the beloved is the truly beautiful, and delicate, and perfect, andblessed; but the principle of love is of another nature, and is such asI have described.\\'I said, \\'O thou stranger woman, thou sayest well; but, assuming Love tobe such as you say, what is the use of him to men?\\' \\'That, Socrates,\\'she replied, \\'I will attempt to unfold: of his nature and birth I havealready spoken; and you acknowledge that love is of the beautiful. Butsome one will say: Of the beautiful in what, Socrates and Diotima?--orrather let me put the question more clearly, and ask: When a man lovesthe beautiful, what does he desire?\\' I answered her \\'That the beautifulmay be his.\\' \\'Still,\\' she said, \\'the answer suggests a further question:What is given by the possession of beauty?\\' \\'To what you have asked,\\'I replied, \\'I have no answer ready.\\' \\'Then,\\' she said, \\'let me put theword \"good\" in the place of the beautiful, and repeat the question oncemore: If he who loves loves the good, what is it then that he loves?\\'\\'The possession of the good,\\' I said. \\'And what does he gain whopossesses the good?\\' \\'Happiness,\\' I replied; \\'there is less difficultyin answering that question.\\' \\'Yes,\\' she said, \\'the happy are made happyby the acquisition of good things. Nor is there any need to ask why aman desires happiness; the answer is already final.\\' \\'You are right.\\'I said. \\'And is this wish and this desire common to all? and do all menalways desire their own good, or only some men?--what say you?\\' \\'Allmen,\\' I replied; \\'the desire is common to all.\\' \\'Why, then,\\' sherejoined, \\'are not all men, Socrates, said to love, but only some ofthem? whereas you say that all men are always loving the same things.\\'\\'I myself wonder,\\' I said, \\'why this is.\\' \\'There is nothing to wonderat,\\' she replied; \\'the reason is that one part of love is separatedoff and receives the name of the whole, but the other parts have othernames.\\' \\'Give an illustration,\\' I said. She answered me as follows:\\'There is poetry, which, as you know, is complex and manifold. Allcreation or passage of non-being into being is poetry or making, and theprocesses of all art are creative; and the masters of arts are all poetsor makers.\\' \\'Very true.\\' \\'Still,\\' she said, \\'you know that they are notcalled poets, but have other names; only that portion of the art whichis separated off from the rest, and is concerned with music and metre,is termed poetry, and they who possess poetry in this sense of the wordare called poets.\\' \\'Very true,\\' I said. \\'And the same holds of love. Foryou may say generally that all desire of good and happiness is only thegreat and subtle power of love; but they who are drawn towards himby any other path, whether the path of money-making or gymnastics orphilosophy, are not called lovers--the name of the whole is appropriatedto those whose affection takes one form only--they alone are said tolove, or to be lovers.\\' \\'I dare say,\\' I replied, \\'that you are right.\\'\\'Yes,\\' she added, \\'and you hear people say that lovers are seeking fortheir other half; but I say that they are seeking neither for the halfof themselves, nor for the whole, unless the half or the whole be also agood. And they will cut off their own hands and feet and cast them away,if they are evil; for they love not what is their own, unless perchancethere be some one who calls what belongs to him the good, and whatbelongs to another the evil. For there is nothing which men love butthe good. Is there anything?\\' \\'Certainly, I should say, that there isnothing.\\' \\'Then,\\' she said, \\'the simple truth is, that men love thegood.\\' \\'Yes,\\' I said. \\'To which must be added that they love thepossession of the good?\\' \\'Yes, that must be added.\\' \\'And not only thepossession, but the everlasting possession of the good?\\' \\'That must beadded too.\\' \\'Then love,\\' she said, \\'may be described generally as thelove of the everlasting possession of the good?\\' \\'That is most true.\\'\\'Then if this be the nature of love, can you tell me further,\\' she said,\\'what is the manner of the pursuit? what are they doing who show allthis eagerness and heat which is called love? and what is the objectwhich they have in view? Answer me.\\' \\'Nay, Diotima,\\' I replied, \\'if Ihad known, I should not have wondered at your wisdom, neither should Ihave come to learn from you about this very matter.\\' \\'Well,\\' she said,\\'I will teach you:--The object which they have in view is birth inbeauty, whether of body or soul.\\' \\'I do not understand you,\\' I said;\\'the oracle requires an explanation.\\' \\'I will make my meaning clearer,\\'she replied. \\'I mean to say, that all men are bringing to the birth intheir bodies and in their souls. There is a certain age at which humannature is desirous of procreation--procreation which must be in beautyand not in deformity; and this procreation is the union of man andwoman, and is a divine thing; for conception and generation are animmortal principle in the mortal creature, and in the inharmonious theycan never be. But the deformed is always inharmonious with the divine,and the beautiful harmonious. Beauty, then, is the destiny or goddessof parturition who presides at birth, and therefore, when approachingbeauty, the conceiving power is propitious, and diffusive, and benign,and begets and bears fruit: at the sight of ugliness she frowns andcontracts and has a sense of pain, and turns away, and shrivels up, andnot without a pang refrains from conception. And this is the reason why,when the hour of conception arrives, and the teeming nature is full,there is such a flutter and ecstasy about beauty whose approach is thealleviation of the pain of travail. For love, Socrates, is not, as youimagine, the love of the beautiful only.\\' \\'What then?\\' \\'The love ofgeneration and of birth in beauty.\\' \\'Yes,\\' I said. \\'Yes, indeed,\\' shereplied. \\'But why of generation?\\' \\'Because to the mortal creature,generation is a sort of eternity and immortality,\\' she replied; \\'and if,as has been already admitted, love is of the everlasting possessionof the good, all men will necessarily desire immortality together withgood: Wherefore love is of immortality.\\'All this she taught me at various times when she spoke of love. And Iremember her once saying to me, \\'What is the cause, Socrates, of love,and the attendant desire? See you not how all animals, birds, as well asbeasts, in their desire of procreation, are in agony when they take theinfection of love, which begins with the desire of union; whereto isadded the care of offspring, on whose behalf the weakest are ready tobattle against the strongest even to the uttermost, and to die for them,and will let themselves be tormented with hunger or suffer anythingin order to maintain their young. Man may be supposed to act thus fromreason; but why should animals have these passionate feelings? Can youtell me why?\\' Again I replied that I did not know. She said to me: \\'Anddo you expect ever to become a master in the art of love, if you do notknow this?\\' \\'But I have told you already, Diotima, that my ignorance isthe reason why I come to you; for I am conscious that I want a teacher;tell me then the cause of this and of the other mysteries of love.\\'\\'Marvel not,\\' she said, \\'if you believe that love is of the immortal,as we have several times acknowledged; for here again, and on the sameprinciple too, the mortal nature is seeking as far as is possible to beeverlasting and immortal: and this is only to be attained by generation,because generation always leaves behind a new existence in the place ofthe old. Nay even in the life of the same individual there is successionand not absolute unity: a man is called the same, and yet in the shortinterval which elapses between youth and age, and in which every animalis said to have life and identity, he is undergoing a perpetual processof loss and reparation--hair, flesh, bones, blood, and the whole bodyare always changing. Which is true not only of the body, but also of thesoul, whose habits, tempers, opinions, desires, pleasures, pains, fears,never remain the same in any one of us, but are always coming and going;and equally true of knowledge, and what is still more surprising to usmortals, not only do the sciences in general spring up and decay,so that in respect of them we are never the same; but each of themindividually experiences a like change. For what is implied in the word\"recollection,\" but the departure of knowledge, which is ever beingforgotten, and is renewed and preserved by recollection, and appears tobe the same although in reality new, according to that law of successionby which all mortal things are preserved, not absolutely the same, butby substitution, the old worn-out mortality leaving another new andsimilar existence behind--unlike the divine, which is always the sameand not another? And in this way, Socrates, the mortal body, or mortalanything, partakes of immortality; but the immortal in another way.Marvel not then at the love which all men have of their offspring; forthat universal love and interest is for the sake of immortality.\\'I was astonished at her words, and said: \\'Is this really true, Othou wise Diotima?\\' And she answered with all the authority of anaccomplished sophist: \\'Of that, Socrates, you may be assured;--thinkonly of the ambition of men, and you will wonder at the senselessness oftheir ways, unless you consider how they are stirred by the love of animmortality of fame. They are ready to run all risks greater far thanthey would have run for their children, and to spend money and undergoany sort of toil, and even to die, for the sake of leaving behind thema name which shall be eternal. Do you imagine that Alcestis would havedied to save Admetus, or Achilles to avenge Patroclus, or your ownCodrus in order to preserve the kingdom for his sons, if they had notimagined that the memory of their virtues, which still survives amongus, would be immortal? Nay,\\' she said, \\'I am persuaded that all men doall things, and the better they are the more they do them, in hope ofthe glorious fame of immortal virtue; for they desire the immortal.\\'Those who are pregnant in the body only, betake themselves to women andbeget children--this is the character of their love; their offspring,as they hope, will preserve their memory and giving them the blessednessand immortality which they desire in the future. But souls which arepregnant--for there certainly are men who are more creative in theirsouls than in their bodies--conceive that which is proper for the soulto conceive or contain. And what are these conceptions?--wisdom andvirtue in general. And such creators are poets and all artists who aredeserving of the name inventor. But the greatest and fairest sort ofwisdom by far is that which is concerned with the ordering of statesand families, and which is called temperance and justice. And he who inyouth has the seed of these implanted in him and is himself inspired,when he comes to maturity desires to beget and generate. He wandersabout seeking beauty that he may beget offspring--for in deformity hewill beget nothing--and naturally embraces the beautiful rather thanthe deformed body; above all when he finds a fair and noble andwell-nurtured soul, he embraces the two in one person, and to such anone he is full of speech about virtue and the nature and pursuits of agood man; and he tries to educate him; and at the touch of the beautifulwhich is ever present to his memory, even when absent, he brings forththat which he had conceived long before, and in company with him tendsthat which he brings forth; and they are married by a far nearer tie andhave a closer friendship than those who beget mortal children, for thechildren who are their common offspring are fairer and more immortal.Who, when he thinks of Homer and Hesiod and other great poets, wouldnot rather have their children than ordinary human ones? Who would notemulate them in the creation of children such as theirs, which havepreserved their memory and given them everlasting glory? Or who wouldnot have such children as Lycurgus left behind him to be the saviours,not only of Lacedaemon, but of Hellas, as one may say? There is Solon,too, who is the revered father of Athenian laws; and many others thereare in many other places, both among Hellenes and barbarians, who havegiven to the world many noble works, and have been the parents of virtueof every kind; and many temples have been raised in their honour for thesake of children such as theirs; which were never raised in honour ofany one, for the sake of his mortal children.\\'These are the lesser mysteries of love, into which even you, Socrates,may enter; to the greater and more hidden ones which are the crown ofthese, and to which, if you pursue them in a right spirit, they willlead, I know not whether you will be able to attain. But I will do myutmost to inform you, and do you follow if you can. For he who wouldproceed aright in this matter should begin in youth to visit beautifulforms; and first, if he be guided by his instructor aright, to love onesuch form only--out of that he should create fair thoughts; and soonhe will of himself perceive that the beauty of one form is akin to thebeauty of another; and then if beauty of form in general is his pursuit,how foolish would he be not to recognize that the beauty in every formis and the same! And when he perceives this he will abate his violentlove of the one, which he will despise and deem a small thing, andwill become a lover of all beautiful forms; in the next stage he willconsider that the beauty of the mind is more honourable than the beautyof the outward form. So that if a virtuous soul have but a littlecomeliness, he will be content to love and tend him, and will search outand bring to the birth thoughts which may improve the young, until heis compelled to contemplate and see the beauty of institutions and laws,and to understand that the beauty of them all is of one family, and thatpersonal beauty is a trifle; and after laws and institutions he willgo on to the sciences, that he may see their beauty, being not likea servant in love with the beauty of one youth or man or institution,himself a slave mean and narrow-minded, but drawing towards andcontemplating the vast sea of beauty, he will create many fair and noblethoughts and notions in boundless love of wisdom; until on that shore hegrows and waxes strong, and at last the vision is revealed to him ofa single science, which is the science of beauty everywhere. To this Iwill proceed; please to give me your very best attention:\\'He who has been instructed thus far in the things of love, and who haslearned to see the beautiful in due order and succession, when he comestoward the end will suddenly perceive a nature of wondrous beauty (andthis, Socrates, is the final cause of all our former toils)--a naturewhich in the first place is everlasting, not growing and decaying, orwaxing and waning; secondly, not fair in one point of view and foulin another, or at one time or in one relation or at one place fair, atanother time or in another relation or at another place foul, as if fairto some and foul to others, or in the likeness of a face or hands or anyother part of the bodily frame, or in any form of speech or knowledge,or existing in any other being, as for example, in an animal, orin heaven, or in earth, or in any other place; but beauty absolute,separate, simple, and everlasting, which without diminution and withoutincrease, or any change, is imparted to the ever-growing and perishingbeauties of all other things. He who from these ascending under theinfluence of true love, begins to perceive that beauty, is not far fromthe end. And the true order of going, or being led by another, to thethings of love, is to begin from the beauties of earth and mount upwardsfor the sake of that other beauty, using these as steps only, and fromone going on to two, and from two to all fair forms, and from fair formsto fair practices, and from fair practices to fair notions, until fromfair notions he arrives at the notion of absolute beauty, and at lastknows what the essence of beauty is. This, my dear Socrates,\\' said thestranger of Mantineia, \\'is that life above all others which man shouldlive, in the contemplation of beauty absolute; a beauty which if youonce beheld, you would see not to be after the measure of gold, andgarments, and fair boys and youths, whose presence now entrances you;and you and many a one would be content to live seeing them only andconversing with them without meat or drink, if that were possible--youonly want to look at them and to be with them. But what if man had eyesto see the true beauty--the divine beauty, I mean, pure and clear andunalloyed, not clogged with the pollutions of mortality and all thecolours and vanities of human life--thither looking, and holdingconverse with the true beauty simple and divine? Remember how in thatcommunion only, beholding beauty with the eye of the mind, he will beenabled to bring forth, not images of beauty, but realities (for hehas hold not of an image but of a reality), and bringing forth andnourishing true virtue to become the friend of God and be immortal, ifmortal man may. Would that be an ignoble life?\\'Such, Phaedrus--and I speak not only to you, but to all of you--were thewords of Diotima; and I am persuaded of their truth. And being persuadedof them, I try to persuade others, that in the attainment of thisend human nature will not easily find a helper better than love: Andtherefore, also, I say that every man ought to honour him as I myselfhonour him, and walk in his ways, and exhort others to do the same,and praise the power and spirit of love according to the measure of myability now and ever.The words which I have spoken, you, Phaedrus, may call an encomium oflove, or anything else which you please.When Socrates had done speaking, the company applauded, and Aristophaneswas beginning to say something in answer to the allusion which Socrateshad made to his own speech, when suddenly there was a great knocking atthe door of the house, as of revellers, and the sound of a flute-girlwas heard. Agathon told the attendants to go and see who were theintruders. \\'If they are friends of ours,\\' he said, \\'invite them in, butif not, say that the drinking is over.\\' A little while afterwards theyheard the voice of Alcibiades resounding in the court; he was in a greatstate of intoxication, and kept roaring and shouting \\'Where is Agathon?Lead me to Agathon,\\' and at length, supported by the flute-girl and someof his attendants, he found his way to them. \\'Hail, friends,\\' he said,appearing at the door crowned with a massive garland of ivy and violets,his head flowing with ribands. \\'Will you have a very drunken man asa companion of your revels? Or shall I crown Agathon, which was myintention in coming, and go away? For I was unable to come yesterday,and therefore I am here to-day, carrying on my head these ribands, thattaking them from my own head, I may crown the head of this fairest andwisest of men, as I may be allowed to call him. Will you laugh at mebecause I am drunk? Yet I know very well that I am speaking the truth,although you may laugh. But first tell me; if I come in shall we havethe understanding of which I spoke (supra Will you have a very drunkenman? etc.)? Will you drink with me or not?\\'The company were vociferous in begging that he would take his placeamong them, and Agathon specially invited him. Thereupon he was led inby the people who were with him; and as he was being led, intending tocrown Agathon, he took the ribands from his own head and held them infront of his eyes; he was thus prevented from seeing Socrates, who madeway for him, and Alcibiades took the vacant place between Agathon andSocrates, and in taking the place he embraced Agathon and crowned him.Take off his sandals, said Agathon, and let him make a third on the samecouch.By all means; but who makes the third partner in our revels? saidAlcibiades, turning round and starting up as he caught sight ofSocrates. By Heracles, he said, what is this? here is Socrates alwayslying in wait for me, and always, as his way is, coming out at all sortsof unsuspected places: and now, what have you to say for yourself, andwhy are you lying here, where I perceive that you have contrived to finda place, not by a joker or lover of jokes, like Aristophanes, but by thefairest of the company?Socrates turned to Agathon and said: I must ask you to protect me,Agathon; for the passion of this man has grown quite a serious matter tome. Since I became his admirer I have never been allowed to speak toany other fair one, or so much as to look at them. If I do, he goes wildwith envy and jealousy, and not only abuses me but can hardly keep hishands off me, and at this moment he may do me some harm. Please to seeto this, and either reconcile me to him, or, if he attempts violence,protect me, as I am in bodily fear of his mad and passionate attempts.There can never be reconciliation between you and me, said Alcibiades;but for the present I will defer your chastisement. And I must begyou, Agathon, to give me back some of the ribands that I may crown themarvellous head of this universal despot--I would not have him complainof me for crowning you, and neglecting him, who in conversation is theconqueror of all mankind; and this not only once, as you were the daybefore yesterday, but always. Whereupon, taking some of the ribands, hecrowned Socrates, and again reclined.Then he said: You seem, my friends, to be sober, which is a thing not tobe endured; you must drink--for that was the agreement under which Iwas admitted--and I elect myself master of the feast until you arewell drunk. Let us have a large goblet, Agathon, or rather, he said,addressing the attendant, bring me that wine-cooler. The wine-coolerwhich had caught his eye was a vessel holding more than two quarts--thishe filled and emptied, and bade the attendant fill it again forSocrates. Observe, my friends, said Alcibiades, that this ingenioustrick of mine will have no effect on Socrates, for he can drink anyquantity of wine and not be at all nearer being drunk. Socrates drankthe cup which the attendant filled for him.Eryximachus said: What is this, Alcibiades? Are we to have neitherconversation nor singing over our cups; but simply to drink as if wewere thirsty?Alcibiades replied: Hail, worthy son of a most wise and worthy sire!The same to you, said Eryximachus; but what shall we do?That I leave to you, said Alcibiades.\\'The wise physician skilled our wounds to heal (from Pope\\'s Homer, Il.)\\'shall prescribe and we will obey. What do you want?Well, said Eryximachus, before you appeared we had passed a resolutionthat each one of us in turn should make a speech in praise of love, andas good a one as he could: the turn was passed round from left to right;and as all of us have spoken, and you have not spoken but have welldrunken, you ought to speak, and then impose upon Socrates any taskwhich you please, and he on his right hand neighbour, and so on.That is good, Eryximachus, said Alcibiades; and yet the comparison ofa drunken man\\'s speech with those of sober men is hardly fair; andI should like to know, sweet friend, whether you really believe whatSocrates was just now saying; for I can assure you that the very reverseis the fact, and that if I praise any one but himself in his presence,whether God or man, he will hardly keep his hands off me.For shame, said Socrates.Hold your tongue, said Alcibiades, for by Poseidon, there is no one elsewhom I will praise when you are of the company.Well then, said Eryximachus, if you like praise Socrates.What do you think, Eryximachus? said Alcibiades: shall I attack him andinflict the punishment before you all?What are you about? said Socrates; are you going to raise a laugh at myexpense? Is that the meaning of your praise?I am going to speak the truth, if you will permit me.I not only permit, but exhort you to speak the truth.Then I will begin at once, said Alcibiades, and if I say anything whichis not true, you may interrupt me if you will, and say \\'that is a lie,\\'though my intention is to speak the truth. But you must not wonder ifI speak any how as things come into my mind; for the fluent and orderlyenumeration of all your singularities is not a task which is easy to aman in my condition.And now, my boys, I shall praise Socrates in a figure which will appearto him to be a caricature, and yet I speak, not to make fun of him, butonly for the truth\\'s sake. I say, that he is exactly like the busts ofSilenus, which are set up in the statuaries\\' shops, holding pipes andflutes in their mouths; and they are made to open in the middle, andhave images of gods inside them. I say also that he is like Marsyas thesatyr. You yourself will not deny, Socrates, that your face is like thatof a satyr. Aye, and there is a resemblance in other points too. Forexample, you are a bully, as I can prove by witnesses, if you will notconfess. And are you not a flute-player? That you are, and a performerfar more wonderful than Marsyas. He indeed with instruments used tocharm the souls of men by the power of his breath, and the players ofhis music do so still: for the melodies of Olympus (compare Arist. Pol.)are derived from Marsyas who taught them, and these, whether they areplayed by a great master or by a miserable flute-girl, have a powerwhich no others have; they alone possess the soul and reveal the wantsof those who have need of gods and mysteries, because they are divine.But you produce the same effect with your words only, and do not requirethe flute: that is the difference between you and him. When we hear anyother speaker, even a very good one, he produces absolutely no effectupon us, or not much, whereas the mere fragments of you and your words,even at second-hand, and however imperfectly repeated, amaze and possessthe souls of every man, woman, and child who comes within hearing ofthem. And if I were not afraid that you would think me hopelessly drunk,I would have sworn as well as spoken to the influence which they havealways had and still have over me. For my heart leaps within me morethan that of any Corybantian reveller, and my eyes rain tears whenI hear them. And I observe that many others are affected in the samemanner. I have heard Pericles and other great orators, and I thoughtthat they spoke well, but I never had any similar feeling; my soul wasnot stirred by them, nor was I angry at the thought of my own slavishstate. But this Marsyas has often brought me to such a pass, that Ihave felt as if I could hardly endure the life which I am leading (this,Socrates, you will admit); and I am conscious that if I did not shut myears against him, and fly as from the voice of the siren, my fate wouldbe like that of others,--he would transfix me, and I should grow oldsitting at his feet. For he makes me confess that I ought not to live asI do, neglecting the wants of my own soul, and busying myself with theconcerns of the Athenians; therefore I hold my ears and tear myself awayfrom him. And he is the only person who ever made me ashamed, which youmight think not to be in my nature, and there is no one else who doesthe same. For I know that I cannot answer him or say that I ought not todo as he bids, but when I leave his presence the love of popularity getsthe better of me. And therefore I run away and fly from him, and when Isee him I am ashamed of what I have confessed to him. Many a time haveI wished that he were dead, and yet I know that I should be much moresorry than glad, if he were to die: so that I am at my wit\\'s end.And this is what I and many others have suffered from the flute-playingof this satyr. Yet hear me once more while I show you how exact theimage is, and how marvellous his power. For let me tell you; none of youknow him; but I will reveal him to you; having begun, I must go on. Seeyou how fond he is of the fair? He is always with them and is alwaysbeing smitten by them, and then again he knows nothing and is ignorantof all things--such is the appearance which he puts on. Is he not like aSilenus in this? To be sure he is: his outer mask is the carved headof the Silenus; but, O my companions in drink, when he is opened, whattemperance there is residing within! Know you that beauty and wealth andhonour, at which the many wonder, are of no account with him, and areutterly despised by him: he regards not at all the persons who aregifted with them; mankind are nothing to him; all his life is spent inmocking and flouting at them. But when I opened him, and looked withinat his serious purpose, I saw in him divine and golden images of suchfascinating beauty that I was ready to do in a moment whatever Socratescommanded: they may have escaped the observation of others, but I sawthem. Now I fancied that he was seriously enamoured of my beauty, and Ithought that I should therefore have a grand opportunity of hearing himtell what he knew, for I had a wonderful opinion of the attractions ofmy youth. In the prosecution of this design, when I next went to him, Isent away the attendant who usually accompanied me (I will confess thewhole truth, and beg you to listen; and if I speak falsely, do you,Socrates, expose the falsehood). Well, he and I were alone together, andI thought that when there was nobody with us, I should hear himspeak the language which lovers use to their loves when they are bythemselves, and I was delighted. Nothing of the sort; he conversedas usual, and spent the day with me and then went away. Afterwards Ichallenged him to the palaestra; and he wrestled and closed with meseveral times when there was no one present; I fancied that I mightsucceed in this manner. Not a bit; I made no way with him. Lastly, asI had failed hitherto, I thought that I must take stronger measures andattack him boldly, and, as I had begun, not give him up, but see howmatters stood between him and me. So I invited him to sup with me, justas if he were a fair youth, and I a designing lover. He was not easilypersuaded to come; he did, however, after a while accept the invitation,and when he came the first time, he wanted to go away at once as soon assupper was over, and I had not the face to detain him. The secondtime, still in pursuance of my design, after we had supped, I wenton conversing far into the night, and when he wanted to go away, Ipretended that the hour was late and that he had much better remain. Sohe lay down on the couch next to me, the same on which he had supped,and there was no one but ourselves sleeping in the apartment. All thismay be told without shame to any one. But what follows I could hardlytell you if I were sober. Yet as the proverb says, \\'In vino veritas,\\'whether with boys, or without them (In allusion to two proverbs.); andtherefore I must speak. Nor, again, should I be justified in concealingthe lofty actions of Socrates when I come to praise him. Moreover Ihave felt the serpent\\'s sting; and he who has suffered, as they say, iswilling to tell his fellow-sufferers only, as they alone will be likelyto understand him, and will not be extreme in judging of the sayings ordoings which have been wrung from his agony. For I have been bitten by amore than viper\\'s tooth; I have known in my soul, or in my heart, or insome other part, that worst of pangs, more violent in ingenuous youththan any serpent\\'s tooth, the pang of philosophy, which will make a mansay or do anything. And you whom I see around me, Phaedrus and Agathonand Eryximachus and Pausanias and Aristodemus and Aristophanes, all ofyou, and I need not say Socrates himself, have had experience of thesame madness and passion in your longing after wisdom. Therefore listenand excuse my doings then and my sayings now. But let the attendants andother profane and unmannered persons close up the doors of their ears.When the lamp was put out and the servants had gone away, I thought thatI must be plain with him and have no more ambiguity. So I gave him ashake, and I said: \\'Socrates, are you asleep?\\' \\'No,\\' he said. \\'Doyou know what I am meditating? \\'What are you meditating?\\' he said. \\'Ithink,\\' I replied, \\'that of all the lovers whom I have ever had you arethe only one who is worthy of me, and you appear to be too modest tospeak. Now I feel that I should be a fool to refuse you this or anyother favour, and therefore I come to lay at your feet all that I haveand all that my friends have, in the hope that you will assist me in theway of virtue, which I desire above all things, and in which I believethat you can help me better than any one else. And I should certainlyhave more reason to be ashamed of what wise men would say if I were torefuse a favour to such as you, than of what the world, who are mostlyfools, would say of me if I granted it.\\' To these words he replied inthe ironical manner which is so characteristic of him:--\\'Alcibiades, myfriend, you have indeed an elevated aim if what you say is true, and ifthere really is in me any power by which you may become better; trulyyou must see in me some rare beauty of a kind infinitely higher than anywhich I see in you. And therefore, if you mean to share with me and toexchange beauty for beauty, you will have greatly the advantage of me;you will gain true beauty in return for appearance--like Diomede, goldin exchange for brass. But look again, sweet friend, and see whether youare not deceived in me. The mind begins to grow critical when the bodilyeye fails, and it will be a long time before you get old.\\' Hearing this,I said: \\'I have told you my purpose, which is quite serious, and do youconsider what you think best for you and me.\\' \\'That is good,\\' he said;\\'at some other time then we will consider and act as seems best aboutthis and about other matters.\\' Whereupon, I fancied that he was smitten,and that the words which I had uttered like arrows had wounded him, andso without waiting to hear more I got up, and throwing my coat about himcrept under his threadbare cloak, as the time of year was winter, andthere I lay during the whole night having this wonderful monster inmy arms. This again, Socrates, will not be denied by you. And yet,notwithstanding all, he was so superior to my solicitations, socontemptuous and derisive and disdainful of my beauty--which really, asI fancied, had some attractions--hear, O judges; for judges you shallbe of the haughty virtue of Socrates--nothing more happened, but in themorning when I awoke (let all the gods and goddesses be my witnesses) Iarose as from the couch of a father or an elder brother.What do you suppose must have been my feelings, after this rejection, atthe thought of my own dishonour? And yet I could not help wonderingat his natural temperance and self-restraint and manliness. I neverimagined that I could have met with a man such as he is in wisdom andendurance. And therefore I could not be angry with him or renounce hiscompany, any more than I could hope to win him. For I well knew that ifAjax could not be wounded by steel, much less he by money; and my onlychance of captivating him by my personal attractions had failed. SoI was at my wit\\'s end; no one was ever more hopelessly enslaved byanother. All this happened before he and I went on the expeditionto Potidaea; there we messed together, and I had the opportunity ofobserving his extraordinary power of sustaining fatigue. His endurancewas simply marvellous when, being cut off from our supplies, we werecompelled to go without food--on such occasions, which often happen intime of war, he was superior not only to me but to everybody; there wasno one to be compared to him. Yet at a festival he was the only personwho had any real powers of enjoyment; though not willing to drink, hecould if compelled beat us all at that,--wonderful to relate! nohuman being had ever seen Socrates drunk; and his powers, if I am notmistaken, will be tested before long. His fortitude in enduring cold wasalso surprising. There was a severe frost, for the winter in that regionis really tremendous, and everybody else either remained indoors, or ifthey went out had on an amazing quantity of clothes, and were well shod,and had their feet swathed in felt and fleeces: in the midst of this,Socrates with his bare feet on the ice and in his ordinary dress marchedbetter than the other soldiers who had shoes, and they looked daggers athim because he seemed to despise them.I have told you one tale, and now I must tell you another, which isworth hearing,\\'Of the doings and sufferings of the enduring man\\'while he was on the expedition. One morning he was thinking aboutsomething which he could not resolve; he would not give it up, butcontinued thinking from early dawn until noon--there he stood fixedin thought; and at noon attention was drawn to him, and the rumour ranthrough the wondering crowd that Socrates had been standing and thinkingabout something ever since the break of day. At last, in the eveningafter supper, some Ionians out of curiosity (I should explain that thiswas not in winter but in summer), brought out their mats and slept inthe open air that they might watch him and see whether he would standall night. There he stood until the following morning; and with thereturn of light he offered up a prayer to the sun, and went his way(compare supra). I will also tell, if you please--and indeed I am boundto tell--of his courage in battle; for who but he saved my life? Nowthis was the engagement in which I received the prize of valour: for Iwas wounded and he would not leave me, but he rescued me and my arms;and he ought to have received the prize of valour which the generalswanted to confer on me partly on account of my rank, and I told them so,(this, again, Socrates will not impeach or deny), but he was more eagerthan the generals that I and not he should have the prize. There wasanother occasion on which his behaviour was very remarkable--in theflight of the army after the battle of Delium, where he served among theheavy-armed,--I had a better opportunity of seeing him than at Potidaea,for I was myself on horseback, and therefore comparatively out ofdanger. He and Laches were retreating, for the troops were in flight,and I met them and told them not to be discouraged, and promised toremain with them; and there you might see him, Aristophanes, as youdescribe (Aristoph. Clouds), just as he is in the streets of Athens,stalking like a pelican, and rolling his eyes, calmly contemplatingenemies as well as friends, and making very intelligible to anybody,even from a distance, that whoever attacked him would be likely tomeet with a stout resistance; and in this way he and his companionescaped--for this is the sort of man who is never touched in war; thoseonly are pursued who are running away headlong. I particularly observedhow superior he was to Laches in presence of mind. Many are the marvelswhich I might narrate in praise of Socrates; most of his ways mightperhaps be paralleled in another man, but his absolute unlikeness to anyhuman being that is or ever has been is perfectly astonishing. Youmay imagine Brasidas and others to have been like Achilles; or you mayimagine Nestor and Antenor to have been like Pericles; and the same maybe said of other famous men, but of this strange being you will never beable to find any likeness, however remote, either among men who now areor who ever have been--other than that which I have already suggested ofSilenus and the satyrs; and they represent in a figure not only himself,but his words. For, although I forgot to mention this to you before,his words are like the images of Silenus which open; they are ridiculouswhen you first hear them; he clothes himself in language that is likethe skin of the wanton satyr--for his talk is of pack-asses and smithsand cobblers and curriers, and he is always repeating the same thingsin the same words (compare Gorg.), so that any ignorant or inexperiencedperson might feel disposed to laugh at him; but he who opens the bustand sees what is within will find that they are the only words whichhave a meaning in them, and also the most divine, abounding in fairimages of virtue, and of the widest comprehension, or rather extendingto the whole duty of a good and honourable man.This, friends, is my praise of Socrates. I have added my blame of himfor his ill-treatment of me; and he has ill-treated not only me, butCharmides the son of Glaucon, and Euthydemus the son of Diocles, andmany others in the same way--beginning as their lover he has ended bymaking them pay their addresses to him. Wherefore I say to you, Agathon,\\'Be not deceived by him; learn from me and take warning, and do not be afool and learn by experience, as the proverb says.\\'When Alcibiades had finished, there was a laugh at his outspokenness;for he seemed to be still in love with Socrates. You are sober,Alcibiades, said Socrates, or you would never have gone so far aboutto hide the purpose of your satyr\\'s praises, for all this long story isonly an ingenious circumlocution, of which the point comes in by theway at the end; you want to get up a quarrel between me and Agathon, andyour notion is that I ought to love you and nobody else, and that youand you only ought to love Agathon. But the plot of this Satyric orSilenic drama has been detected, and you must not allow him, Agathon, toset us at variance.I believe you are right, said Agathon, and I am disposed to think thathis intention in placing himself between you and me was only to divideus; but he shall gain nothing by that move; for I will go and lie on thecouch next to you.Yes, yes, replied Socrates, by all means come here and lie on the couchbelow me.Alas, said Alcibiades, how I am fooled by this man; he is determined toget the better of me at every turn. I do beseech you, allow Agathon tolie between us.Certainly not, said Socrates, as you praised me, and I in turn ought topraise my neighbour on the right, he will be out of order in praising meagain when he ought rather to be praised by me, and I must entreat youto consent to this, and not be jealous, for I have a great desire topraise the youth.Hurrah! cried Agathon, I will rise instantly, that I may be praised bySocrates.The usual way, said Alcibiades; where Socrates is, no one else has anychance with the fair; and now how readily has he invented a speciousreason for attracting Agathon to himself.Agathon arose in order that he might take his place on the couch bySocrates, when suddenly a band of revellers entered, and spoiled theorder of the banquet. Some one who was going out having left the dooropen, they had found their way in, and made themselves at home; greatconfusion ensued, and every one was compelled to drink large quantitiesof wine. Aristodemus said that Eryximachus, Phaedrus, and others wentaway--he himself fell asleep, and as the nights were long took a goodrest: he was awakened towards daybreak by a crowing of cocks, andwhen he awoke, the others were either asleep, or had gone away; thereremained only Socrates, Aristophanes, and Agathon, who were drinking outof a large goblet which they passed round, and Socrates was discoursingto them. Aristodemus was only half awake, and he did not hear thebeginning of the discourse; the chief thing which he remembered wasSocrates compelling the other two to acknowledge that the genius ofcomedy was the same with that of tragedy, and that the true artist intragedy was an artist in comedy also. To this they were constrained toassent, being drowsy, and not quite following the argument. And firstof all Aristophanes dropped off, then, when the day was alreadydawning, Agathon. Socrates, having laid them to sleep, rose to depart;Aristodemus, as his manner was, following him. At the Lyceum he took abath, and passed the day as usual. In the evening he retired to rest athis own home.'"
